Project structure and reproducibility is talked about more in the R research community. Here are some projects and blog posts if you're working in R that may help you out.

 - [Project Template](https://projecttemplate.net/index.html) - An R data analysis template
 - "[Designing projects](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/)" on Nice R Code
 - "[My research workflow](https://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/05/06/research-workflow.html)" on Carlboettiger.info
 - "[A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)" in PLOS Computational Biology

Finally, a huge thanks to the [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) project ([github](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter)), which is helping us all spend less time thinking about and writing boilerplate and more time getting things done.
